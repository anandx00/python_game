### 🧭 Tips

- Add GIFs or screenshots in the “Gameplay” section to illustrate the experience.
- Make sure your image/sound file names match exactly the filenames used in the code.
- Consider splitting the monolithic `Screen` class into smaller modules for maintainability.
- Encourage users to show off their high scores or mods in Issues or Discussions.
